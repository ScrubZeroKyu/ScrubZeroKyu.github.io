        <h2>What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?</h2>
        <p>Cross-Site Scripting or XSS is a vulnerability that is found in webpages that enables an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the webpage.<br> 
            An interesting point to note is that while HTML is often what is the attack vector for XSS, it is in reality a vulnerability for all webpage-based languages using the unfiltered tags.<br>
            It can be used to steal private information or to hijack cookies and use them to pretend to be the user.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Types of XSS vulnerabilities</h2>
        <strong>Self:</strong> <p>Self XSS is when the script that is deployed is only sent to the user who put it in.<br> This is low impact and wouldn't be on a bug bounty as the only two things you could do with it are to give someone a script tell them copy paste it or to figure out the underlying reason for the self XSS to try and apply one of the below XSS attacks.</p>
        <strong>Stored:</strong> <p>Stored XSS is when the script tag gets stored onto the webpage making it run on anyone who goes to the webpage in question.<br> This is often the most impactful/dangerous as entire webpages can be compromised and could be used to do privilege escalation if an admin visits the webpage. </p>
        <strong>Reflected:</strong> <p>Reflected XSS is when a payload is injected into a link and runs it if is clicked.<br> As such it is not as severe as stored but again still is dangerous as privilege escalation can still occur, just less likely compared to stored.</p>
        <strong>DOM-Based:</strong> <p> Document Object Model XSS or DOM XSS In DOM-Based XSS, the vulnerability is in the JavaScript in the browser, and not on the server.<br> Scripts are injected into the DOM through unsafe JavaScript functions or DOM manipulations without proper sanitisation, this is mostly beyond the scope of COMP6841 according to lectures </p>

        <h2>Mitigation:</h2>
        <p>The main strategies to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities are to sanitise and filter user input, use Content Security Policy (CSP), and ensure that data is properly encoded.</p>
        
        <h2>Famous Example:</h2>
        <p>TweetDeck XSS Vulnerability (2014)</p>
        <video width="855" height="515" controls>
            <source src="XSS Tweetdeck.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
