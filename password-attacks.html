        <h2>Dictionary Attack</h2>
        <p>A dictionary attack is when an attacker uses a list of the most common passwords to attempt to crack a password, usually automated to test as fast as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Long and complex passwords that haven't been in any breaches.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Rainbow/Lookup Tables</h2>
        <p>Lookup tables are used to match a hash to a plaintext password, though usually only the most common passwords have their hash exposed. Rainbow tables are optimised versions of lookup tables, using hash chains instead of storing every password and hash pair directly.</p>
        <p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Salting, which adds random data to passwords before hashing can make it hard to rainbow/lookup table.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Birthday Attack</h2>
        <p>Using the birthday paradox principle, which refers to the unintuitive probability principle that in a group of 23 people, there is about a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday. Using this we go from 2<sup>n</sup> to 2<sup>n/2</sup> attempts to find a hash collision. This decreases computational time significantly by cutting out half of the exponent on average. 
        <p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Long hashes, like SHA-256, are resistant to birthday attacks due to their length.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Chosen-plaintext Attack</h2>
        <p>The attacker can get the matching cipher text from a plaintext password to try and get information on the encryption algorithm and find patterns to eventually find weaknesses and possibly even crack it. Usually not used on hashes often but can be used to help figure out what algorithm is being used. </p>
        <p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Padding and block randomness make it more difficult for attackers to find any patterns.</p>
