        <h2>What is the Dark Web?</h2>
        <p>The Dark Web is a subset of the deep web that is hidden and often requires specific software, configurations, and or authorisation to access. Unlike the surface web, which is findable by standard search engines it's a lot harder to navigate.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Deep Web vs. Dark Web</h2>
        <p>The Deep Web and the Dark Web are usually confused. The Deep Web includes any online content that isn't searchable by search engines, for example databases, academic journals, and private websites. <br>
            The Dark Web is a subset of the Deep Web that requires special software, usually Tor, to access.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How to Access the Dark Web</h2>
        <p>To access the Dark Web, usually Tor (The Onion Router) is used, which hides their identity and browsing activities by routing traffic through multiple nodes. <br> 
            Usually this is just the first step and a lot more privacy related software is used such as VPNs to further increase anonymity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Common Uses of the Dark Web</h2>
        <p>The Dark Web is used for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> People who prioritise privacy, such as journalists, activists, and whistleblowers, may use the Dark Web to communicate and share information anonymously. As in oppressive countries freedom of speech isn't a thing and not being anonymous could result in drastic consequences.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketplaces:</strong> There are markets on the Dark Web that sell legal and illegal items, a famous example was the silk road which was used for drug purchases until the creator got caught. While some legal products are sold, many of these marketplaces engage in illegal activities or are just scams.</li>
            <li><strong>Forums and Communities:</strong> Many forums on the Dark Web are dedicated to sharing knowledge, often times selling data from breached companies, but a lot of them are sponsored by government agencies to try and find out who was behind certain breaches.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Risks and Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>Not everything on the Dark Web is illegal. However, it is a rather risky place due to the large amounts of scams, malware, and illegal content. Users need to be cautious and aware of the potential dangers before accessing Dark Web sites, even if curious it's best to not go there as you'll probably stuff up some anonymity protocol and get your address leaked to some bad actors.</p>
